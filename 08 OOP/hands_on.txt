1. Create a constructor function to implement a car.
2. It should have model speed and maxSpeed properties.
3. speed is the current speed of the car in km/h.
4. Implement "accelerate" method that will increase the speed by 10 and log new speed to the console.
5. Implement another method "brake" that will decrease the car's speed by 5 and log new speed to the console.
6. Create 2 car objects BMW, and Mercedes and drive them around accelerating till you reach maxSpeed and then apply brakes to slowdown.
